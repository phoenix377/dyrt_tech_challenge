# The Dyrt Tech Challenge

You just started working for a new agency. You have to take over a project for a company called "The Dirt" (with an "i"). A prior coworker made some progress on the project but left things half finished. Your first task is making the app feature complete.

## App Description

"The Dirt" wants a single page app where you can search for a campground, select that campground, and view some basic information about the campground. They are a very new company and going to pilfer the data from their direct competitor "The Dyrt".

## Requirements

1. Data is loaded from The Dyrt's autocomplete endpoint as a user types a query into the search input.
2. Each time a user's mouse enters the dropdown menu an analytics event is logged with an updated list of the results.
3. When a user selects a campground from the dropdown menu, the campground is loaded and some basic information is displayed.

### Extra Credit

1. Let a user navigate the dropdown with the keyboard.
2. Limit unneeded re-renders.
3. Make the app responsive.

## On The Real

The way things stand now there are some pretty glaring bugs in the app and a handful of places that could use some optimization. We want to see how you approach buggy code and what things you really care about. There is no set design for requirement three so use your creativity.
